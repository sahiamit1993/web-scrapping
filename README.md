## Based on the Jupyter Notebook Link

Here's a README file you can use for the GitHub repository linked, assuming the notebook is about numerical programming in Python and web scraping:

**Title:** Numerical Programming in Python and Web Scraping

**Description:**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring numerical programming techniques in Python and their application in web scraping.

**Topics Covered:**

* Introduction to numerical programming with Python (potential topics: NumPy, pandas, SciPy, etc.)
* Web scraping fundamentals and libraries (potential topics: Beautiful Soup, Requests, Selenium, etc.)
* Combining numerical programming and web scraping for data analysis tasks (specific examples from the notebook)

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahiamit1993/web-scrapping.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   The specific dependencies will depend on the libraries used in the notebook. You can usually find them listed in the notebook itself or in a `requirements.txt` file. Install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the notebook:**

   Use a Jupyter Notebook environment to open `Copy_of_Numerical_Programming_in_Python_Web_Scraping.ipynb`.
